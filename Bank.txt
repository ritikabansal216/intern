Simple Bank Account System Documentation

  Purpose:

 * The purpose of the Simple Bank Account System is to simulate the
 * functionality of a basic bank account. This system allows users to perform
 * essential banking operations such as depositing money into an account,
 * withdrawing money from an account, checking the account balance, and exiting
 * the system.
 * 
 * How to Use the Simple Bank Account System:
 * Initialization:
  
 * When you run the program, it initializes a bank account with an account
 * number, account holder name, and an initial balance.
 * In this example, the initial account has an account number "123456," an
 * account holder name "John Doe," and an initial balance of $1000. You can
 * modify these values as needed.
 * User Interface:
 * 
 * The program provides a simple command-line interface for interacting with the
 * bank account.
 * 
 * The following options are available to the user:
 * 
 * 1. Deposit: Allows the user to deposit money into the account. The user needs
 * to enter the deposit amount when prompted.
 * 
 * 2. Withdraw: Allows the user to withdraw money from the account. The user
 * needs to enter the withdrawal amount when prompted.
 * 
 * 3. Check Balance: Displays the account number, account holder name, and the
 * current balance.
 * 
 * 4. Exit: Exits the bank system.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * 
 * To use the system, follow these steps:
 * 
 * Run the program in a Java environment.
 * 
 * The program will display a menu with the available options.
 * 
 * Choose an option by entering the corresponding number (1, 2, 3, or 4) and
 * press Enter.
 * 
 * Depending on the chosen option, the program will prompt you for additional
 * input (e.g., deposit or withdrawal amount).
 * 
 * The program will execute the selected operation and provide feedback on the
 * action taken (e.g., "Deposited $50 into account 123456").
 * 
 * You can continue using the system by selecting other options or exit the
 * system by choosing option 4.
 * 
 * Exit:
 * 
 * To exit the system, choose option 4 ("Exit") from the menu.
 * 
 * The program will display a closing message and terminate gracefully.
