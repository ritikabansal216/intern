 Purpose:
  The purpose of the Java program provided, which prints "Hello, World!" to the
  console, is to serve as a simple introductory example for beginners learning
  the Java programming language. Here's a more detailed explanation of its
  purpose:
 
 * Introduction to Java Syntax: The program introduces fundamental elements of
  Java syntax, such as defining a class, declaring the main method, and using
 the System.out.println() statement to display output on the console.
 
  Starting Point: It serves as a starting point for individuals who are new to
  programming in Java. "Hello, World!" programs are typically the first
  programs people write when learning a new programming language.
  
  Verification of Development Environment: Running this program helps verify
  that your Java development environment is correctly set up and configured. If
  the program runs successfully and displays the "Hello, World!" message, it
  indicates that your Java environment is ready for more complex coding tasks.
  
 * Testing Output: It demonstrates the concept of sending text output to the
  console, which is a fundamental skill for debugging and monitoring the
  behavior of Java applications.
  
  Understanding the Main Method: It showcases the main method, which is the
  entry point of Java applications. In more complex programs, this is where you
  start executing your code.
  
 * In summary, the "Hello, World!" program is a foundational example used to
  introduce the basics of the Java programming language and ensure that the
  development environment is correctly configured.
