 Basic Library Management System Documentation
 * Purpose:
 * The Basic Library Management System is a simplified Java program designed to
 * manage a collection of books. Its primary purpose is to allow users to
 * interact with the library by adding books, listing available books, borrowing
 * books, and returning books.
 * 
 * Key Components:
 * Book Class:
 * 
 * The Book class represents individual books in the library.
 * Each book has attributes such as title, author, and availability status
 * (isAvailable).
 * It provides methods to:
 * Retrieve the title and author of the book.
 * Check if the book is available.
 * Borrow the book.
 * Return the book.
 * Library Class:
 * 
 * The Library class manages a collection of books using a private list of Book
 * objects.
 * It provides methods to:
 * Add books to the library.
 * Get the list of books.
 * Perform other library management operations (which can be added as needed).
 * 
 * Methods in the Basic Library Management System
